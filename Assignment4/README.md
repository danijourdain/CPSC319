# CPSC 319 Winter 2022 Assignment 4

## This file contains instructions on how to run the code files for Assignment 3.

In order to successfully run the main version of this program (Binary Search Tree):

    1) Use the command-line/terminal of your machine to navigate to the folder where this README file was found.
        - Ensure all code files remain in this folder, otherwise there will be issues.
        - Ensure the input text file to be used is also placed in this folder
    
    2) Run the command "javac *.java"

    3) After successful compilation, run the command "java Assign3 input.txt query.txt output1.txt output2.txt"
        - input.txt is the input text file containing the adjacency matrix for the graph
        - query.txt is a text file containing one or more queries to be run.
        - output1.txt is the output text file which will contain the results of the depth-first search for each query.
        - output2.txt is the output text file which will contain the results of the breadth-first search for each query.
        - IMPORTANT: all text files MUST be enetered with the .txt extension, otherwise the program will 
            encounter an error and terminate

In order to successfully run the bonus version of this program:
