# CPSC 319 Winter 2022 Assignment 5

## This file contains instructions on how to run the code files for Assignment 5.

In order to successfully run the main version of this program:

    1) Use the command-line/terminal of your machine to navigate to the folder where this README file was found.
        - Ensure all code files remain in this folder, otherwise there will be issues.
        - Ensure the input text file to be used is also placed in this folder
    
    2) Run the command "javac *.java"

    3) After successful compilation, run the command "java Assign5 input.txt output.txt"
        - input.txt is the input text file containing the list of words to be stored in a HashMap
        - output.txt is the output text file that will contain the HashMap performance statistics
        - IMPORTANT: all text files MUST be enetered with the .txt extension, otherwise the program will 
            encounter an error and terminate

The bonus of this assignment was not implemented.
    
This program does not use any packages or external libraries, so there is no need for special commands to 
be entered. As long as the commands mentioned above are used, the program should run successfully.
